# Hawaii Temperature Exploration with SQLAlchemy and Flask

In this challenge I use the sqlalchemy library in jupyter notebook to connect and map a sqlite database.  The database consisted of temperature and precipitation data from 9 weather stations in Hawaii.  Once the conncetion was made, I was able to use pandas to create a couple of graphics showing precipitation and temperature trends. 

The second part of the repository was done in VS Code. I used the same data set, but was able to use flask to create an API with several routes based on the queries that I developed in the original analysis of the data.
